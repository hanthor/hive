// Per-agent model-call error streaks (#5577; the demotion-signal half of
// #5338).
//
// The signal: an agent whose CLI keeps RUNNING turns while EVERY model call
// dies produces no usage and no output, yet reports green — the bobshell
// opus-4-6 crash loop shape, where the hive's only write-capable agent was
// dead for 4+ days behind a generic "no write" chip. The strongest artifact
// the spoke already records for this is the bobshell chat recording itself:
// every kick appends a user turn, and a SUCCESSFUL call appends an assistant
// reply carrying a usage block (tokens.input/output) — so a run of trailing
// user turns with no usage-bearing reply IS the consecutive-failure streak,
// with per-turn granularity and per-agent attribution via the same
// trustedFolders projectHash mapping the token scanner uses.
//
// Why not the alternatives:
//   - .bob-errors/ logs are direct evidence but free-form text the spoke has
//     never parsed; counting lines conflates one multi-line stack trace with
//     N failures, and the format is version-dependent.
//   - CLI exit tracking misses this class entirely — the CLI stays up and the
//     agent stays green while every call inside it dies (#5338's exact shape).

	// regardless of age.

// or a user turn (older than errorStreakGrace) that never received a reply
// at all, which is what a call that crashes before responding leaves behind.
//
// Agents whose recordings never carry an explicit usage block anywhere in the
// window are skipped: an estimation-era format that records no usage for
// SUCCESSFUL calls either would make every turn look failed. Streaks whose
// newest failure is older than errorStreakMaxAge are dropped as stale. The
// result is always non-nil (an empty map means "measured, no streaks") so
// callers can tell a clean fleet from a scan that never ran.
