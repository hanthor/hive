// Consent-wedge tracking (#5577). A Copilot CLI parked on an interactive
// consent screen passes the "❯" marker check, so the kick path detects it
// via paneShowsConsentScreen and restarts the agent before sending — which
// lands right back on the same consent screen. The result is a restart loop
// (observed live at ~1/min) that the logs record ("consent_screen=true") but
// nothing surfaces: the agent reads green while doing no work. This tracker
// remembers those restarts so the heartbeat can name the wedged agents.

// consentWedgeWindow is how recent a consent-screen restart must be for the
// agent to count as wedged. One restart an hour ago that never recurred means
// the operator completed the consent flow; a live loop refreshes the stamp
// every kick attempt.

// (SendKick / deliverKickAsync), and re-acquiring m.mu there would deadlock
// (see the manager's mutex-reentrancy history).
