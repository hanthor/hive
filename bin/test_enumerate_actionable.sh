# Contract tests for bin/enumerate-actionable.sh.
# Run: bash bin/test_enumerate_actionable.sh
#
# enumerate-actionable.sh writes /var/run/hive-metrics/actionable.json — the
# ONE file merge-gate.sh, kick-agents.sh and the dashboard's contribute lane
# (src/pkg/dashboard/contribute_ws.go) read instead of running their own gh
# queries. Every hold/blocked/draft/ADOPTERS exclusion and the external-issue
# SHA hold/unhold lifecycle (which WRITES labels and comments to GitHub) live
# in this one script. It has been patched by fix PRs (#245, #260, #274, #394,
# #398, #4772) and had no tests: a filter regression would ship green and show
# up as agents picking up held work, or as a hold comment posted to every
# external issue every cycle.
#
# Like bin/test_gh_wrapper_gates.sh this EXECUTES the script rather than
# grepping it. The script hardcodes /usr/bin/gh, /var/run/hive-metrics and
# /var/log/kick-agents.log with no env override, so the harness runs a COPY
# with exactly those three paths rewritten to a temp dir (and asserts the
# rewrite landed — a refactor that renames them must fail here loudly, not
# silently run the tests against the real paths). The stub gh serves canned
# REST/GraphQL fixtures and runs the script's own `--jq` filters through real
# jq (gh's --jq is a jq implementation), so the field mapping and the
# `.pull_request == null` filter are under test, not bypassed.
#
# Doctrine (audit 6/7): every exclusion assertion sits next to a positive
# control that IS included, so an enumerator that emits nothing cannot pass.
# Hermetic: no network, no sleeps (the retry sleep is stubbed), never touches
# /var/run, /data or /tmp/hive.
